This folder should contain the (distributional) vectors from which the density matrices can be build.
We utilize GloVe vectors which can be downloaded at:

in particular in the paper 'Conversational Negation using Worldly Context in Compositional Distributional Semantics' we used the vectors of dimension 50 build from Wikipedia.
